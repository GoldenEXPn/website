# TODO
## Ideas
- there is home, news, team contacts, and login.
    - login logs and check the authorization
    - login leads to a protected router fo web app for visualization, model, and database
- build the structure

- I need to go over the scss files and understand them.
- figure out log-in page, and web-app authorization open, protected route
- figure out the initialization of content
- routing change for gsap animation


## layout 
- intro *NOT FINISHED*
    - only home has intro animation
- header *NOT FINISHED*
    - should be a little fancy
- nav
    - left: 
        - Home, News, contacts
    - right:  *NOT FINISHED*
        - sign me up! (if this should be a pop up) 
        - Login

- log-in *NOT FINISHED*
    - pop up 

- main 
    - all page inside content:
        - home
        - news
        - contacts *NOT FINISHED*

- home
    - about product
- news
    - recent news about the product and the team members
- contacts
    - member cards
        - like posts, pictures in circles, names, contributions (title), description(p), and available social media icons and links in the bottom row.

- When logged in
    - no home, no news, no heading
    - contacts in another style
- web app
    - my page/ main page/ show stats and graphs,
    - about me (nav)
        - my info
        - setting
    - left drawer menu
        - Home visual
        - model param
        - share....
        - .... (ideas)


## challenges for right now.
- scss file might not be compatiable with some preset button or asset libraries, I think those scss layout does a great job in layouts and breakpoints. 
- protected class, for login

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To Build: 

In the project directory, you can run: ```npm install```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
